# SOC-Prediction-Research

## Overview
SOC-Prediction-Research is a dissertation project for MSc Data Analytics and Information Systems Management at Arden University, Berlin. The project focuses on the prediction of soil organic carbon (SOC) for soil samples taken between 2009 and 2018 for the LUCAS project of the European Union through geospatial modelling&#8203;``oaicite:{"number":1,"metadata":{"title":"GitHub - JhaNishant/soc-prediction-research: Prediction of soil organic carbon for soil samples taken between 2009 and 2018 for the LUCAS project of the European Union through geospatial modelling.","url":"https://github.com/JhaNishant/soc-prediction-research","text":"Prediction of soil organic carbon for soil samples taken between 2009 and 2018 for the LUCAS project of the European Union through geospatial modelling","pub_date":null}}``&#8203;.
