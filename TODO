# Things for analysis

With 'soc_percent' as your target variable, you can perform various analyses to understand the relationship between 'soc_percent' and other features in your dataset. Here are some possible analyses:

Done! Correlation analysis: You can calculate the correlation coefficient between 'soc_percent' and other features to understand the strength and direction of the linear relationship between them. A high positive correlation indicates that as the value of one feature increases, the value of 'soc_percent' also increases, while a high negative correlation indicates that as the value of one feature increases, the value of 'soc_percent' decreases.

Done! Regression analysis: You can perform regression analysis to build a model that predicts 'soc_percent' using other features in the dataset. You can use various regression techniques like linear regression, polynomial regression, or any other regression method that suits your data.

Done! Permutation Feature importance analysis: You can analyze the importance of each feature in predicting 'soc_percent'. You can use techniques like feature importance ranking or decision tree-based methods like random forest or gradient boosting.

Clustering analysis: You can perform clustering analysis to group similar samples based on their feature values. You can then compare the 'soc_percent' values for each cluster to understand the distribution of 'soc_percent' values within each cluster.

Dimensionality reduction: You can use techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize the relationship between 'soc_percent' and other features in a lower-dimensional space. This can help you identify any patterns or clusters in the data.
